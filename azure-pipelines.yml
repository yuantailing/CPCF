# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:

stages:
- stage: Stage_A

  - job: Prepare
    steps:
    - script: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=ci_all;isOutput=true]true"
      name: ProduceVar
      condition: contains(variables['Build.SourceVersionMessage'], '[ci all]')

- stage: Stage_B
  dependsOn: Stage_A
